# WorldBuilder
Artistic planet generator with a strong foundation in science.

## Examples
Can be found [here](http://quinnmueller.me/planetGenerator). Most of them were created from the current main branch.

## How Do I Build It?
Good question. I'm working on a portable build. Until then, everything under the WorldGenerator folder has no requirements other than the standard library. If you want to use the current main() for grpc, it requires linking against libgrpc++ and libprotobuf.10.

## Want to support the project?
I have a [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/PlanetGenerator). Any support is greatly appreciated, but by no means required. Contributions will go towards myself, hosting costs for sharing rendered simulations, and high resolution simulation runs to share with the public (I would like to eventually do ones ~1000x of the ones you can currently see, requiring a machine with upwards of 500GB of RAM).

If other contributors are accepting donations, I will add links to them here.
